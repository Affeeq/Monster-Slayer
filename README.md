### This is the first project from the Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide by Maximilan Schwarzmuller on Udemy

#### About
* This is a simple game which a player controls his/her actions and the monster will attack back

#### How to play
* Player need to click start new game to begin
* Player can decide to use attack or special attack to inflict damage
* Player can use heal to increase health
* Player can decide to give up the game and start a new game

#### Code
* This a new branch created for the code along from the course. The only edit is that on the heal method, the heal value is random with an if else statement that check whether player's health is going over 100.
